Q.1 Print the reverse order series using a while loop.

Solution:
numbers = [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]

index = 6
while index >=1:
   print(f"The reversed series is = {numbers[index]}")
   index  = index - 1

Output: 
The reversed series is = 16
The reversed series is = 15
The reversed series is = 14
The reversed series is = 13
The reversed series is = 12
The reversed series is = 11

Q.2 Create a code that describe the use of break statement in while loop.

Solution:
numbers = 1

while numbers < 6:
    print(numbers)
    if numbers == 4:
        break
    numbers = numbers + 1

Output:
1
2
3
4

Q.3 Write a Python program using a while loop to iterate through each character of the string "Python" and print each character on a new line. Additionally, calculate and print the length of the string.

Solution:
str = "python"

index=0
while index < len(str):
    print(str[index])
    index = index + 1
print("The lenght of string is: ",len(str))

Output: 
p
y
t
h
o
n
The lenght of string is:  6

Q.4 Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and calculates its factorial using a while loop. Display the result as the factorial of the entered number.

Solution: 
number = int(input("enter a number: "))

factorial = 1
i = 1
while i <= number:
    factorial = factorial * i
    i = i + 1
print("The factorial of", number, "is:",factorial)

Output: 
enter a number:  5
The factorial of 5 is: 120
