Q.1 Write a Python program that takes a number as input and prints "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.

Solution: 
# Taking input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Checking if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

Output: 
Enter a number:  4
Even

Q.2 Create a Python program that checks whether a person is eligible to vote (18 years or older) based on their age.

Solution:
# Function to check voting eligibility
def check_voting_eligibility(age):
    if age >= 18:
        return "You are eligible to vote."
    else:
        return "You are not eligible to vote."

# Input: Getting the age from the user
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Output: Display whether the person is eligible to vote or not
print(check_voting_eligibility(age))

Output: 
Enter your age:  21
You are eligible to vote.

Q.3 Write a Python program that determines if a given year is a leap year or not.

Solution: 
def is_leap_year(year):
    # A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100,
    # unless it is also divisible by 400.
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Input from the user
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if the year is a leap year
if is_leap_year(year):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")

Output:
Enter a year:  2028
2028 is a leap year

Q.4  Create a Python program that checks if a user-given number is positive, negative, or zero.

Solution: 
# Get user input
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero
if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")

Output: 
Enter a number:  -5
The number is negative.

Q.5 Write a Python program that determines the largest of three numbers entered by the user.

Solution:
# Get input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Determine the largest number
largest = max(num1, num2, num3)

# Display the result
print(f"The largest number is: {largest}")

Output: 
Enter the first number:  20
Enter the second number:  30
Enter the third number:  80
The largest number is: 80.0
